# checkmate

A minimalist/extensible lib to handle failures and retries in a gracefull way.

I wanted a few things:

* Pluggable retry strategies
* Extreme simplicity
* Composable
* Not an avalanche of dynamic vars
* Pluggable reporting via success/error/failure callbacks

## Documentation

Right now it has 2 default RetryStrategies implementations (it's a protocol):

* delay-runner
* max-runner

each `run` takes a `runner` instance and options, which can be

* `:success `: by default `identity` - function called on successfull return
* `:error`: by default `noop` - function called on intermediary error
* `:failure`: by default #(throw %) - function called when the run failed

We also supply `logging-callbacks` that does the same as
`default-callbacks` but logs everything as a tuple of `[state,
return-or-error]`.

Enough words, code:

```clj
(use 'qbits.checkmate)

;; the default
;; after 10 failed tries without pause it'll retrow last error
(run max-runner #(do something that might fail))

;; in fact this translates to

(run max-runner
     #(do something that might fail)
     {:max 10 ;; try max 10 times
      :success (fn [ret] ret) ;; just return value if ok
      :failure #(throw %) ;; throw on failure after 10 tries
      :error identity}) ;; do nothing in intermediate failures

```

This is quite simple, unobtrusive, you can add metrics/reporting
easily on top of that.

The other strategy takes a seq of delays:

``` clj

(run delay-runner {:delays (take 50 (exponential-backoff 100))})
(run delay-runner {:delays (take 20 (constant-backoff 100))}) ;; try every 100ms
(run delay-runner {:delays (sane-backoff)})

;; etc

```
Delays must just be a (potentially infinite) lazy seq of ms, super
easy to generate manipulate.

The 3 shown before are just:
``` clj
(defn constant-backoff [ms]
  (repeat ms))

(defn exponential-back-off [x]
  (iterate #(* Math/E %) x))

(defn sane-backoff [x]
  (lazy-cat
   (repeat x 100)
   (repeat x 500)
   (repeat x 1500)
   (repeat x 15000)
   (repeat x 60000)))
```


The whole lib is under 100 lines, easy to understand, modify, extend.
